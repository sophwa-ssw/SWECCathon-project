Husky Seeker

Husky Seeker is designed to mix scavenger hunts, campus tours, and Among Us into one competitive, educational, and fun game. 

Players will be sent all around campus to visit landmarks, learn new facts, solve riddles, and explore, giving students new and old a better understanding of the campus they call home. 

Keeping them on their toes and moving will be the Imposters, tasked to find and hunt down all the players before they can finish their tasks.

Will you succeed in navigating campus and revealing all the Imposters before they eliminate you first? Or will you sneakily hunt down all the players by following them to their task locations?
